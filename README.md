Hi, I'm Jade. I'm an experienced Quality Engineer living in Scotland ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate about the delivery of accessible and easy-to-use digital applications. I have hands-on experience with multiple test automation frameworks using JavaScript.

In my spare time, you can find me walking my sausage dog or playing games online.
